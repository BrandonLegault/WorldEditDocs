Want to see selection lines?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see lines that show what you have selected, then you need to install `WorldEditCUI <https://github.com/mikroskeem/WorldEditCUI/releases>`_, a client-side mod. Note that the mod requires `Fabric <https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install>`__, so you will need to install that first.

.. note::
    If you would like to use an older version of Minecraft (1.12 or before), in addition to downloading an older WorldEdit (version 6), you will also need the older `WorldEditCUI mod <https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1292886-worldeditcui>`_ by Mumfrey. Note that this version requires LiteLoader (installation instructions on that page) instead of Fabric.

.. tip::

    Don't want to install client mods? You can access a limited version of the selection outlines server-side via the ``//drawsel`` command. It only works for cuboid selections less than 32x32x32 in size, and you must be in creative mode. These restrictions are due to how structure blocks work in Minecraft.
